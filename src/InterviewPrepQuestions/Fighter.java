    //        Create a function that returns the name of the winner in a fight between two fighters.
//        9
//        Each fighter takes turns attacking the other and whoever takes the life of the other first is
//        victorious. Victory is defined as decreasing opponentâ€™s health <= 0.
//        Each fighter will be a Fighter object/instance (which contains name, health, damagePerAttack and
//                also setInfomethod).
//                Both health and damagePerAttackwill be integers and larger than 0.
//        Example 1:
//        input :
//        Fighter tom = new Fighter(); tom.setInfo("Tom", 10, 2);
//        Fighter harry = new Fighter(); harry.setInfo("Harry", 5, 4);
//        declareWinner(tom, harry, "Tom")
//        output : "Tom wins"
//        Explanation :
//        Tom attacks Harry; Harry now has 3 health.
//                Harry attacks Tom; Tom now has 6 health.
//                Tom attacks Harry; Harry now has 1 health.
//                Harry attacks Tom; Tom now has 2 health.
//                Tom attacks Harry: Harry now has -1 health and is dead. Tom wins.
