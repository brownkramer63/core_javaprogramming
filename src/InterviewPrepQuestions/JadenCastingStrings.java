//        Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and
//        After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via
//        Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word.
//                For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected
//        to be in the example below.
//        Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings
//        are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he
//        originally typed them.
//                Example:
//        Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
//        Jaden-Cased: "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"
//        Note that this function should a return empty string for an empty string or null.
